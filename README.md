This repo is still under development!

SeeKim Jewelry is a jewelry line created by Christine Kim. All products are hand-made and are simple, yet elegant. This website is currently being made using AngularJS and Browserify for the front-end and Node.js and Express for the back-end.

The website will feature a slideshow lookbook, a gallery, links to all of seekim jewelry's social media, and a webstore. It will be constantly updated based on the available products as well as the changing fashion lines/trends.
